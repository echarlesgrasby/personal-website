	<span><h1>A Bit About Myself</h1>
		<p>As you gleamed from the homepage, my name is Eric Grasby. I've spent my life thus far in the Central Arkansas Area. From growing up, to school, to college, to starting a career (and falling in love!)- I've spent my days in Little Rock.
		While I would eventually like to move out of state and experience what it is like to live elsewhere- this state will always be home.
		</p>	
		<p>My wife, Caroline, is more than just a partner- she's a force of nature. I've never met someone with as much drive, determiniation, and conviction as she has. I am extremely proud to be her husband- we wed in Fall of 2020.
		She and I met during the outset of college and have been inseparable ever since. As the brains of our partnership, she's a degreed Systems Engineer from the University of Arkansas at Little Rock. I honestly cannot wait to see
		where life takes the two of us.

<article> <!--INTERESTS --> 
	<h2>Career & Technical Interests</h2>
		<p>I hold a Master of Science in Information Quality from the University of Arkansas at Little Rock, and am deeply interested in approaches to quality control and assurance (especially as it pertains to software).
		My main career experience has been in database development, though I recently shifted to a Programmer/Analyst role at a power systems company headquartered in Little Rock.
		</p>
	<h2>Kendo</h2>
		<p>One of the things that I enjoy most about Little Rock is actually being a member of the Arkansas Kendo Club. Kendo (literally "The Way Of The Sword")
		is one of the most rewarding disciplines I have ever joined. The study of it is more than just a martial art- it becomes a way to connect with others, and
		demonstrates an upstanding manner in which one can live their life. If anyone in the Central Arkansas Area is interested, I highly recommend checking the
		dojo out <a href="http://arkansas-kendo.com/" target="_blank">here.</a>
