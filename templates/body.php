	<h2> What have I been up to recently? </h2>
		<p>I recently successfully defended my MS project, "Improving The Quality Of Manufacturing Information Via The Implementation Of An Employee Knowledge Base." I'm now trying to figure out how to fill the void left by finishing graduate school.</p>
		<p>I've also begun to spend time learning LaTeX, which is what my résumé is currenly written in</p>
		<p>There's not really much else to say. Drop me a line if you have an interesting project you'd like to work on. I've got some experience in database development and shell scripting.</p>
